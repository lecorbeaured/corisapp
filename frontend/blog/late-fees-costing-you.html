        <h1>Late Fees Are Costing Americans $150+ Per Year. Here's How to Stop.</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">5 min read · February 2026</div>

        <p>Late fees feel small in isolation. A $25 charge here, a $35 penalty there. But over a year, they add up to a staggering cost — and the worst part is, most of them are completely preventable.</p>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
          <strong>$157 per year</strong>
          <span>Average late fees paid by U.S. households annually — most from bills they simply forgot about.</span>
        </div>

        <h2>It's not a money problem. It's a visibility problem.</h2>
        <p>Here's what most people don't realize: the majority of late payments aren't caused by insufficient funds. They're caused by insufficient awareness. You had the money. You just didn't know the bill was due until after the deadline passed.</p>
        <p>Credit card late fees average $32. Utility late fees range from $5 to $50. Rent late fees can hit $50 to $100. Miss two or three bills a month and you're burning $100+ before you've even bought groceries.</p>

        <h2>Why autopay isn't the full answer</h2>
        <p>Autopay solves the forgetting problem, but it creates a new one: surprise withdrawals. When three autopay charges hit on the same day and you haven't planned for them, you end up with overdraft fees — which cost even more than late fees.</p>
        <p>Autopay works best when paired with a bill tracker that shows you what's coming. That way you know what will auto-debit and when, and you can make sure the money's there.</p>

        <h2>The $150 fix</h2>
        <p>If you can see every bill that's due between now and your next paycheck — with the exact amounts and due dates — you stop missing things. It's that simple. No complex budgeting system, no bank linking, no financial advisor. Just a list of what you owe, mapped to when you get paid.</p>
        <p>That's the core idea behind CORIS. You enter your recurring bills once, set your pay schedule, and the app assigns each bill to the right paycheck window. You see what's due, mark it paid, and move on.</p>

        <h2>The ripple effect</h2>
        <p>Eliminating late fees does more than save you $150 a year. Late payments reported to credit bureaus can drop your score by 60–110 points. A lower credit score means higher interest rates on everything — your car loan, your mortgage, your credit cards. One missed bill can cost you thousands over time.</p>
        <p>The fix isn't complicated. It's visibility. And it starts with knowing what's due.</p>
