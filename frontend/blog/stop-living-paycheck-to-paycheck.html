        <p>Living paycheck to paycheck isn't always about how much you earn. Plenty of people with solid incomes still feel that familiar dread when the bank balance dips to double digits two days before payday. The real issue, more often than not, is visibility. You're not broke — you're blind to what's coming.</p>

        <h2>The problem isn't spending. It's not knowing.</h2>
        <p>Most financial advice starts with "track your spending." And sure, that helps. But if you have six bills due between now and Friday, the most detailed spending log in the world won't help if you don't know those bills exist until the late notice arrives.</p>
        <p>The paycheck-to-paycheck cycle doesn't start with bad spending habits. It starts with a simple gap: you don't have a clear picture of what's due, when, and how much — mapped against the money that's actually coming in.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Write down every recurring bill</h2>
        <p>Not in a spreadsheet that you'll forget about. Not in a notes app buried under grocery lists. In one dedicated place where you can see all of them at once. Rent, utilities, subscriptions, insurance, car payment, phone bill — all of it. Include the amount and the day of the month it's due.</p>
        <p>This step alone is eye-opening. Most people discover they have 12–20 recurring bills and can only name half of them from memory.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Know your pay dates</h2>
        <p>If you get paid biweekly, you have 26 pay periods a year — not 24. That matters. Some months have three paydays. Others only have two, and those months feel tighter even if your income hasn't changed.</p>
        <p>Write down your next few pay dates. Now you have two lists: what's going out, and when money's coming in.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Match bills to paychecks</h2>
        <p>This is where things click. Take each bill and assign it to the paycheck that arrives just before it's due. Now instead of one overwhelming pile of obligations, you have smaller, manageable groups: "these four bills come out of this paycheck, those three come out of the next one."</p>
        <p>Suddenly you're not wondering if you can afford rent. You already know — because you planned for it before the money even landed.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Mark bills paid as you go</h2>
        <p>Every time you pay a bill, mark it done. This creates a running record and immediate peace of mind. You stop asking "did I pay that?" because the answer is right in front of you.</p>

        <h2>This is exactly what CORIS does</h2>
        <p>We built CORIS for people who are tired of guessing. You enter your bills, set your pay schedule, and CORIS assigns each bill to the right paycheck window automatically. No bank linking, no transaction importing — just a clear plan you control.</p>
